  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Vodka Pasta, better known as the Gigu Hadid Pasta is a dish made of typically penne pasta, soaked in creamy tomato sauce. Although the recipe calls for actual vodka, this recipe does not have vodka in it.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato paste</li>
      <li>Half of a chopped onion</li>
      <li>3-4 pieces of minced garlic</li>
      <li>Half a cup of oil(preferably avacado or olive</li>
      <li>One cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>Seasonings(paprika,black pepper, chilli flakes, and garlic powder)</li>
      <li>Pasta of choice</li>
      <li>1/4th cup of pasta water</li>
      <li>Optional-Meat of choice</li>
    </ul>
  <h1>Making the Sauce</h1>
    </ul><p>While waiting for your pasta to boil, start prepping your sauce. Take a pan, pour in your oil, onions, garlic, and seasoning. Let sautee.<br></br>After sauteed. add in tomato paste, bring heat to high, and let sit till the paste <strong>begins to shrink</strong>.<br></br> Once shrunk, slowly pour in your heavy whipping cream and mix until combined.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like to add cheese to my sauce for taste, but it is not necessary. After the sauce is made, take the starchy water from the boiling pasta and add to your sauce. This works as a thickener.</p>
