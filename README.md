  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Vodka Pasta, better known as the Gigi Hadid Pasta is a dish made of typically penne pasta, soaked in creamy tomato sauce. Although the recipe calls for actual vodka, this recipe does not have vodka in it. I enjoy making this for my family, as the recipe serves around 6 people. I think this pasta is really relevant to me because I usually make it with my sister. In a way, we use this time to bond with each other. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato paste</li>
      <li>Half of a chopped onion</li>
      <li>3-4 pieces of minced garlic</li>

  <h1>Making the Sauce</h1>
    </ul><p>While waiting for your pasta to boil, start prepping your sauce. Take a pan, pour in your oil, onions, garlic, and seasoning. Let sautee.<br></br>After sauteed. add in tomato paste, bring heat to high, and let sit till the paste <strong>begins to shrink</strong>.<br></br> Once shrunk, slowly pour in your heavy whipping cream and mix until combined.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like to add cheese to my sauce for taste, but it is not necessary. After the sauce is made, take the starchy water from the boiling pasta and add to your sauce. This works as a thickener.</p>
